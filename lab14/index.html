      Lab 14: Debugging Tools and Strategies
      </h1>
        <p>
          With my partner, we experimented with debugging tools and strategies to fix old assignments.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <h2> Challenge </h2>
          <p>
            My partner and I did not have any major errors to debug in our previous labs so we decided to research and experiment more with the Debugger Function in Javascript and implemented that into our old Lab 8.
          </p>

          <br></br>
        <h2> Problems </h2>
          <p>
            My partner and I didn't have any major problems throughout all our labs that needed debugging.
            However for this assignment we experimented and researched more about the debugger function and used it for lab8.
            After seeing how the function worked and what it was capable of was very interesting.

        <h2> Results </h2>

              We are adding breakpoints in our Javascript file. To check if the user has input a correct number and checks for any errors.
