      <h1>
      Lab 16: JSON and APIs
      </h1>
        <p>
          Working with my partner, we experimented with processing JSON from an API.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <h2> Challenge </h2>
          <p>
            While working on this lab, my partner and I had to create a website using an API from the XKCD comic.
          </p>

          <br></br>
        <h2> Problems </h2>
          <p>
            While working on this lab, we didn't encounter any major problems as we used the jQuery recipe provided in the lab.
            Small minor problems that occured when doing this lab were minor syntax errors that were fixed through the use
            of the console. One problem that we still occurs in our lab is not being able to display the full alt string whenever
            you hover over the comic. Part of the string is cut off and we are not too sure why, but we believe it may have
            something to do with our syntax when adding the alt tag to the image.
          </p>
