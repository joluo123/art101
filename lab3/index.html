		<h1> Lab 3 File Structure </h1>
		<p>
			In this lab, we learned the importance of creating a local file structure on my local computer. This allowed us to easily
			locate and organize our folders for each individual lab that we encounter.
		</p>
		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p>
			Overall, creating the file structure was not rather difficult and I was able to create an organized file structure where I can easily
			locate specific folders and files whenever I need them for future labs.
		</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p>
			Here is a screenshot of my work for creating a file structure.
