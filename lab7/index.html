      Lab 7: Functions
      </h1>
      <p>
        Working with my partner, we wrote functions that take user input and manipulate a string.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h2> Challenge </h2>
      <p>
        My partner and I did not face too many challenges when working on this lab.
        The instructions were clear enough for my partner and I to understand
        what each task is asking for.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h2> Problems </h2>
      <p>
        My partner and I did not encounter any problems when working on this lab.
        We used w3schools to have a clearer understanding on which each function does
        when working converting the userinput into arrays and sub-strings.
      </p>

      <h2> Results </h2>
