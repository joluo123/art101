      Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web
      </h1>
      <p>
        Working with my partner we experimented with DOM manipulation in Javascript.
      </p>

      <h2> Challenge </h2>
      <p>
        While working on this lab, it was challenging at first to understand what DOM manipulation is in Javascript and how
        it is used alongside with HTML. The task challenges in this lab was confusing in the beginning, but after learning
        how DOM manipulation works for both Javscript and HTML it was starting to become more clear for me.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h2> Problems </h2>
      <p>
        My partner and I never messed with DOM manipulation before so we ran into a few errors when writing our code. We used
        W3Schools to read more on the elements and methods used for DOM manipulation. Some errors we ran into were null and syntax
        errors, but after reading more on these errors we were able to solve them in our code.
