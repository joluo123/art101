		<h1>
		Lab 6: Arrays and Objects
		</h1>
		<p>
			Working with my partner we experimented with JavaScript Arrays and Objects.
		</p>
		<br></br>
		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p>
			My partner and I did not face too much challenges when working on the tasks
			in Lab 6. The directions in each task was clear enough to understand what was
			expected of us to do.
		</p>
		<br></br>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p>
			The only minor problem that occured was trying to display the Javascript file
			onto our index.html file. However, after reading and looking through our source code
			a second time, we found a few syntax errors that prevented us from displaying the text
			onto the browser.
		</p>
		<br></br>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p>
			Here are the results from our Javascript File and index.html.
			<div id="divcontent">
