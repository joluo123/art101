      I live in San Francisco, and currently staying at home due to quarentine.
      During my free time, I enjoy playing video games with my friends. Currently, I have been playing a lot of Valorant and Old School Runescape.
      I also enjoying watching and playing sports specifically basketball.
      I enjoy listening to Rap, EDM, Pop, and Lofi music whenever I am studying or doing work.
      In the future, I plan to pursue a carrer in the UX/UI carrer field or the game industry. I enjoy design and technology so I believe
      that I would pursuing this carrer path.

      I would like to consider myself a very extroverted guy. I've been active in social orgs
      at school such as Japanese Student Association and Korean American Student Association.
      In my free time I normally would hangout with friends but ever since quarentine started I've
      been playing a lot of videogames in my free time. The main game I've been running with my
      friends is Valorant which is a competitive shooter. I also have a dog named buddy. Hes
      a dachshund and I love him a lot. In the future I would like to have some sort of job in
      gaming industry. As of right now any role would be a super fun experience for me but if I
      had to choose I would proably aim for producer or something with level design.
