      Lab 13: Loops
      </h1>
        <p>
          Working with my partner we experimented with loops in Javascript.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <h2> Challenge </h2>
          <p>
            My partner and I created a function that uses a for loop to find the factors of specific values to label their output string.
          </p>

          <br></br>
        <h2> Problems </h2>
          <p>
            While working on this lab, we did not have any specific problems as the instructions in each task was clear enough for us to understand
            what was expected of us. The only minor problems that occured were small syntax errors, but those were resolved easily with using the
            console on our browser.
          </p>
          <br></br>

        <h2> Results </h2>
        <p> <a class = "sourceLink" href="js/lab.js" target = "source"> Javascript Source &gt ; &gt ; </a></p>
        <p>
          <b> Enter The Maximum Value! </b> <br></br>
          <input type = "text" id = "input">
          <button id = "button"> Submit </button>
        </p>
            <div id = "output">
              <h3> Here are the Results: </h3>
            </div>
