      Lab 10: Javascript Events and Forms
      </h1>
      <p>
        Working with my partner we experimented with Javascript Events.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h2> Challenge </h2>
      <p>
        While working on this lab, it was challenging at first to fully understand how to work with Javascript Event Handlers
        and using them within HTML. I have worked with Javascript event handlers in the past when developing games, but never with
        HTML so that was a new experience for me.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h2> Problems </h2>
      <p>
        During this lab, the main problem that occured was having the addEventListener function call a specific function that I wanted it to
        call. At first, I wasn't too sure why the event listener was not detecting the function that I was calling. While reading through the lines of code again,
        my partner and I realized that it was a syntax error regarding the parameters. Other than that, there wasn't any major problems that occured as the instructions
        within each task was clear enough to understand.
