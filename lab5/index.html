		Lab 5: Data Types and Variables

		<p>
			Working wtih your partner, experiment with basic
			JavaScript data types and variables.

		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p>
			For the most part this lab wasn't really a challenge for us. The
			only thing we really had to do was just make sure we didn't have
			any small errors that would make our program not run.
		</p>
		<br></br>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p>
			My partner and I had no problems while performing this lab.
		</p>
		<br></br>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p>
			Not only can you look at our screenshots in our googledoc but you can look
			at our index.html files we created to see our results.
			Here is the program execution:
