      I live in San Francisco, and currently staying at home due to quarentine.
      During my free time, I enjoy playing video games with my friends. Currently, I have been playing a lot of Valorant and Old School Runescape.
      I also enjoying watching and playing sports specifically basketball.
      I enjoy listening to Rap, EDM, Pop, and Lofi music whenever I am studying or doing work.
      In the future, I plan to pursue a carrer in the UX/UI carrer field or the game industry. I enjoy design and technology so I believe
      that I would pursuing this carrer path. I enjoy watching anime and currently I am following Attack of Titan and Jujutsu Kaisen.
