      Lab 11: Libraries and jQuery
      </h1>
        <p>
          Working with my partner we experimented with jQuery.

      <div id = "challenge">
        <h2> Challenge </h2>
          <p>
            While starting on this task, it was confusing in the beginning learning how to use
            the jQuery syntax. After reading the lecture slides and with the help of w3Schools
            my partner and I were able to understand how to use jQuery syntax and replace the regular
            DOM syntax expressions we would generally use. Once we started to understand how to use this
            syntax is did not feel as challenging anymore.

      </div>
      <div id = "problems">
        <h2> Problems </h2>
          <p>
            Overall, a few minor problems my partner and I had were genreally syntax errors that would appear.
            This is due to the fact that we never really used jQuery before so the syntax is really new to us.
            However, this wasn't a major problem as we would use W3School is help us adjust to the new syntax and understand
            what each function is doing within jQuery. The instructions for each task were also clear enough for us to understand
            what was expected from us in each task.
