      Lab 15: AJAX
      </h1>
        <p>
          With my partner, we experimented with jQuery and AJAX
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <h2> Challenge </h2>
          <p>
            In this lab, my partner and I worked with AJAX and jQuery. We hooked the Number API to our Javascript file using jQuery and Created
            a text input area where the user can input a number to search in the Number API.
          </p>

          <br></br>
        <h2> Problems </h2>
          <p>
            The biggest problem my partner and I came across in this lab was what AJAX and API actually is. With the help of W3schools and Youtube tutorials we were able to
            get a better understanding of what was covered in lecture and how it all functions. Both of us had no experience using this so it was super interesting to
            learn and research about.
          </p>
          <br></br>

        <h2> Results </h2>
          <p>
            <p> <a class = "sourceLink" href="js/lab.js" target = "source"> Javascript Source &gt ; &gt ; </a> </p>
            <p> Enter a Number to find in the Number API </p>
            <p> <input type = "text" id = "input"> <p>
            <p> <button id = "activate"> Click Here! </button> </p>
          </p>
            <div id = "output">

            </div>
  </body>
