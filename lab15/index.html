      Lab 15: AJAX
      </h1>
        <p>
          With my partner, we experimented with jQuery and AJAX
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <h2> Challenge </h2>
          <p>
            In this lab, my partner and I worked with AJAX and jQuery. We found a random user generator online and used their API in our Javascript where it will randomly
            generate a random user when the button is clicked.
          </p>

          <br></br>
        <h2> Problems </h2>
          <p>
            The biggest problem my partner and I came across in this lab was what AJAX and API actually is. With the help of W3schools and Youtube tutorials we were able to
            get a better understanding of what was covered in lecture and how it all functions. Both of us had no experience using this so it was super interesting to
            learn and research about. However besides that we also had trouble finding an API link that works with Github and that took a while for us to find. And even though
            we found one we weren't able to figure out how to get rid of all the unecessary text.

        <h2> Results </h2>
          <p>
            <p> <a class = "sourceLink" href="js/lab.js" target = "source"> Javascript Source &gt ; &gt ; </a> </p>
            <p> <button id = "activate"> Click Here! </button> </p>
          </p>
            <div id = "output">
